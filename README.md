# Part Segmentation Experiments

This repository contains experiments on 3D furniture part segmentation using
SAMPart3D and manual geometry-based processing.

## Contents
- `inference.py` – inference and segmentation pipeline
- `segmentation_code.ipynb` – main experimentation notebook
- `part_manual.ipynb` – manual post-processing and clustering
- `outcome_viz.ipynb` – visualization of segmentation results
- `assets/` – sample meshes and visual assets
- `manual_output/` – processed part-level outputs (legs, frame, tabletop)

## Notes
- Pretrained models are **not** included.
- This repo focuses on segmentation logic and post-processing strategies.
